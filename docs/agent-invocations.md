# Agent invocation protocol

Agent Comms separates durable messages, runtime notifications, and execution
claims. Posting a message never grants execution authority by itself.

An invocation progresses through `PENDING`, `NOTIFIED`, `CLAIMED`, `RUNNING`,
`WAITING`, and a terminal state (`COMPLETED`, `REJECTED`, `EXPIRED`, or
`DEAD_LETTER`). Notification and claim reservations are authoritative
transactions, so competing daemons or runtime instances cannot both deliver
or claim the same invocation.

## Agent workflow

```sh
agent-comms runtime register \
  --id reviewer-runtime --agent reviewer --connector MCP --max-concurrent 1

agent-comms runtime heartbeat \
  --actor reviewer --id reviewer-runtime --health HEALTHY

agent-comms invocation next --actor reviewer --runtime reviewer-runtime
agent-comms invocation claim --actor reviewer --id inv-123 --runtime reviewer-runtime
agent-comms invocation start --actor reviewer --id inv-123 --summary "Review started"
agent-comms invocation wait --actor reviewer --id inv-123 --reason "Waiting for CI"
agent-comms invocation resume --actor reviewer --id inv-123 --summary "CI completed"
agent-comms invocation complete --actor reviewer --id inv-123 --summary "Review passed"
```

Equivalent MCP tools are available for runtimes embedded in an agent host.
Owners can cancel non-terminal work with
`agent-comms invocation cancel --id inv-123 --reason "superseded"`.

Connected runtimes should hold a bounded listen open instead of polling:

```sh
agent-comms invocation listen \
  --actor reviewer --runtime reviewer-runtime --wait 10s --claim
```

The equivalent `invocation_listen` MCP tool waits for pushed work for up to ten
seconds and claims it transactionally by default. Agent hosts repeat the
bounded listen after a timeout or completed invocation. Competing runtime
instances cannot both claim the same invocation.

## User policy

Owners and orchestrators configure each target agent:

```sh
agent-comms invocation policy set \
  --agent reviewer --mode TRUSTED --trusted-actor builder \
  --require-human-for-sensitive
```

Modes are:

- `MANUAL`: each agent-originated invocation requires an approval;
- `TRUSTED`: only named active actors may invoke the target;
- `AUTOMATIC`: authorized active agents may invoke the target;
- `DISABLED`: agent-originated invocation is disabled.

Owners and orchestrators retain emergency control. Sensitive work continues to
use the existing human approval system. Invocation scopes must fit both the
requester and target agent scopes and, when configured, the target policy's
allowed scopes. A non-routine related task or an urgent invocation requires a
human approval when `require_human_for_sensitive` is enabled.

`agent-comms control overview`, `control attention`, and `control settings`
provide automation-friendly views of the same project control plane shown in
the TUI.

## Local connector configuration

Runtime events contain only a configuration reference. Connector commands and
environment values are stored in a mode-0600 per-user JSON file and never in
project history:

```json
{
  "connectors": {
    "reviewer-local": {
      "type": "LOCAL_PROCESS",
      "executable": "/opt/agents/reviewer",
      "arguments": ["--invocation", "{invocation_id}"],
      "working_directory": "/srv/project",
      "timeout": "30s"
    }
  }
}
```

Set `AGENT_COMMS_CONNECTOR_CONFIG` to this file and register the runtime with
`--config-reference reviewer-local`. Local process connectors receive a
bounded JSON invocation envelope on standard input and identifiers in
`AGENT_COMMS_PROJECT_ID`, `AGENT_COMMS_INVOCATION_ID`,
`AGENT_COMMS_AGENT_ID`, and `AGENT_COMMS_RUNTIME_ID`.

The daemon reserves a delivery before launching a connector. Failed launches
use exponential backoff, stop after ten attempts, and become `DEAD_LETTER`.
MCP connectors must be online; manual connectors create an auditable
notification for the human control room.

Webhook connectors push the same bounded envelope to an agent host:

```json
{
  "connectors": {
    "reviewer-webhook": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "endpoint": "https://agents.example.internal/invocations",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer secret-from-this-private-file"
      },
      "timeout": "10s"
    }
  }
}
```

Register it with `--connector WEBHOOK --config-reference reviewer-webhook`.
Remote webhook endpoints must use HTTPS; loopback HTTP is allowed for local
agent hosts. Redirects are rejected, headers and responses are bounded, and
connector secrets remain outside project history. A successful webhook wake-up
returns a 2xx response; the target then uses `invocation_listen` or the normal
claim/start/complete tools to acknowledge and process the invocation.

An online runtime becomes offline when its heartbeat is older than 45 seconds.
Draining and revoked states are never overwritten by heartbeat expiry.
